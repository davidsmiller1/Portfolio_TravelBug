              Guerrilla testing was conducted on 5 users. Based on the testing results, 90% of users completed Task 1 to successfully sign up for the app and sign in under 1 minute passing the 80% success rate. Additionally, 100% of users stated that the Covid Safety Rating was somewhat easy or very easy to find passing the 80% success rate for Task 2. 
              Overall the app was received positively. Most functions worked properly. Users provided helpful feedback about minor design and function changes which is outlined in the rest of this report.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Through the ideation and design process, it has become clear that there is a need for an app that serves this type of purpose: to inform travelers, especially families with children, about safe travel options, so they can travel again during or after the pandemic. Current travel apps do not have a feature like this.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h3 class="card-title">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In order for TravelBug to function properly, research must now be conducted on the public health best practices and contact tracing for each hospitality and travel company that would like to participate.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h3 class="card-title">Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In conclusion, despite the Covid-19 global pandemic, there is demand from families with children to be able to travel again and take the once prized family vacation. For many families, safety is their top concern, and the travel app, TravelBug can support them in making the best decisions to keep everyone healthy while planning vacations again. The app is well received in user testing. Many functional and aesthetic design changes were made from ideation to prototyping to refine the usability of the app. Once complete, TravelBug will help to bring happiness to families seeking to safely leave the confines of their homes, and to revive an economy that has been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 global pandemic.</p>
